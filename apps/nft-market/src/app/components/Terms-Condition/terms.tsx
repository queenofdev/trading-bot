            <li>
              A significant risk of losses of your cryptocurrencies, inherent with
              trading, holding, and transacting;
            </li>
            <li>
              Risk of the partial or total loss of your cryptocurrencies due to the
              exploitation by third parties of the balance.capital, fantohm.com,
              liqdnft.com and usdbalance.com smart contracts, coding errors, UI, domain,

            <li>
              The price and liquidity of your cryptocurrencies may be subject to large
              fluctuations. The value of cryptocurrencies is derived from the continued
              willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for
              cryptocurrencies, which may result in the potential for a permanent and
              total loss of value of your Cryptocurrencies should the market for your
              Cryptocurrencies disappear;
            </li>
            <li>
              Transactions made with Cryptocurrencies on the blockchains are irreversible,
              and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions are
              not recoverable;

            <li>
              All Cryptocurrency transactions made on the balance.capital, fantohm.com,
              liqdnft.com, and usdbalance.com websites are deemed to be made when recorded
              on a Blockchain public ledger. Therefore, the general nature of said
              transactions may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack.
